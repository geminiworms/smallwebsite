<b>this is an ongoing project about love.</b> a while back, the words "i love you" stopped meaning anything to me. i stopped believing them. everytime i fell into a pocket of insecurity, i found myself craving more words; ones that told me exactly what they meant by love. but all i ever got was "i love you" over and over again. and so i started doing this exercise in my notes app and through it, i found better ways to recognize love within myself and in others... and ways to express love with intentionality and specificity. it came up again a few months later with my dear friend kristina who found herself "struggling with cheap i love yous" in the highs of new love. i told her about this, and it evolved into a whole data table on alternate forms of "i love you". here's where that data ended up, i hope you love it.

    <p><b>this is an ongoing project about love</b><br><br>
      it started as an exercise i'd do in my notes app to ground myself off of blanket statement, band-aid "i love yous"... <br>
      but it had the unexpected benefit of helping me practice self love (sorry, buzzword, dont know what else to call it though) with
      more refined intentions and greater specificity. it came up again months later when my dear friend kristina told me she was "struggling with <br>
      cheap <i>i love yous</i> in the highs of new love"... i shared this with her and it snowballed into a spreadsheet of all the alternate ways
      you can say it. <br>
